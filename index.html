                  <p>Also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
                The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. 
                Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. This is my favourite band because:
                Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, self-love 
                Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
                The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.
